Got it, I'll focus more on the terminal and its functionalities. Hereâ€™s the updated README file:

# WebShell

![costume1 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e694a042-cc9e-426b-a6b2-596b2314f7ce)

WebShell is a browser-based Linux terminal experience designed for **development and testing**. This project was created as an experiment to see if the node.js module `child_process` with the export `exec` could power an entire terminal, and to fulfill the need for terminal technologies in the browser.

## Features

- **RHEL-based terminal**: The terminal uses **Amazon Linux**, which is based on **Fedora/CentOS**.
- **Browser-based**: Access a fully interactive Linux terminal directly from your browser.
- **Pre-installed tools**: Essential development tools and utilities are available, such as `curl`.
- **API Access**: Programmatically run commands via an API.

## API

WebShell includes an API to execute commands programmatically.

### Endpoint

```http
URL: https://web-terminal-eight.vercel.app/run
Method: POST
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body: {"command": "your_linux_command_here"}
```

### Example

To try it, run the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://web-terminal-eight.vercel.app/run -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command": "ls -l"}'
```

## How it Works

WebShell uses AWS with a Node.js runtime deployed on Vercel. The `typeset` command in the terminal can display the environment variables.
